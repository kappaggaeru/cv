            Coding for four years in the young, then starting college at the age of 19, I have learned a few of everything from planning the goals of a project to writing the whole back-end.

            My main language it's been Java from 3 years until now and I have earned concern about UX and UI, I do like both front and back so I really hope becoming a full-stack dev.
