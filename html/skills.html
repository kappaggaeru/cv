            <p>I've used Java for 4 years until now, in college I have worked with algorithms and techniques such as Backtracking, Greedy, sorting algorithms, binary trees and I have studied POO principles.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Also I have worked with other technologies like Hibernate, JPA and JPQL.</p>

            <p>A few years ago I didn’t care about web applications but in college I have gained a lot of interest in UI and UX, I have studied the structure of HTML from scratch, I really care about good designs, I really enjoy when I see some cool design and I try my best to get there someday, still got a lot to learn.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I started using JS just for simple stuff like the behavior of a form or things like that, but then I did other things like a demo of a game with spreadsheets, a silly game with poker cards and a lot of websites for assignments.</p>
